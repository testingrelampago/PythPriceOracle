# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install -g solc
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

npm install dotenv --save-dev
npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
npx hardhat compile
npm install forge-std


```
